# PolarPrinter
PolarPrinter is a webapp written in C++ using GLES 2.0/WebGL (using cheerp compiler to compile to WASM/asm.js/their own subset of JS) intended to be used as a simulation for a 3D printer using a polar coordinate system in order to determine if it can be faster and more precise than other types of FDM printers. Project is currently on hold
